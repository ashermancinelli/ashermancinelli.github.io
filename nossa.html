  <h1>Nossa Familia Coffee - 9/10</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Delicious, well-balanced, predominantly Brazilian roasts and espresso.</p>

<hr>

<p>Iâ€™ve had espresso from Nossa before at their northern location in the Pearl where I had one of their in-house roasts, but when I stopped by for this review they had a roast from Keia &amp; Martynâ€™s Coffee roasters (also based out of Portland).
This black-owned roaster was featured in the SE Nossa cafe I visited for the month of June (Iâ€™ll just have to revisit when they have their own roasts on espressoðŸ˜‰).</p>

<p>The Colombian Yeny Capiz roast from Keia &amp; Martynâ€™s <em>radical</em> line had flavor comps of molasses, sweet red tea, citrus, and candied hazelnut, though I didnâ€™t get much of the citrus.
My coffee tasted balanced, nutty, and a bit sweet; the molasses and candied hazelnut came through pretty clearly to me.</p>

<p>Augusto Carneiro started Nossa to bring his familyâ€™s coffee to Portland from Brazil, and the shop continues to pride itself on the farmer-roaster relationships they have with all of their growers, which now come from Guatemala, Nicaragua, Peru, Ethiopia as well.</p>

<p>My coffee was solid: well-rounded, tasty, not overpowering.
It didnâ€™t show up Courier or Sterling, but it was also clearly in the top echelon of coffees Iâ€™ve had in the city.</p>
