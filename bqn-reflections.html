  The Leetcode problem is “Set Matrix Zeroes”

where we’re tasked with setting rows and columns of a matrix that contain zero to be all zeroes.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-joy-of-programming">On the Joy of Programming</h2>

<p>It’s been a few months since I’ve written BQN or APL, so I feel like I’m looking at the language family with fresh eyes.</p>

<p>I was struck by the resemblance between solving this leetcode problem and creating art:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I know I’m not the best at either, and many, <em>many</em> people can write more elegant BQN and more elegant poetry than I can (for example)</li>
  <li>I can thoroughly enjoy both when detached from any performance metrics - the process is far more valuable to me than the end-product</li>
  <li>both can be deeply social actions - sharing your painting with someone and discussing my solution with the BQN chat room are both social and exciting. Even if someone comes back with a more wonderful painting or more terse solution, I enjoy the social interaction just as much.</li>
</ol>

<p>I stumbled upon this thread on twitter describing how Kurt Vonnegut responded to a letter from a high school English student asking for life advice.
In short, his response was to do art and enjoy the process of becoming who you are.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tear it up into teeny-weeny pieces, and discard them into widely separated trash receptacles. You will find that you have already been gloriously rewarded for your poem. You have experienced becoming, learned a lot more about what’s inside you, and you have made your soul grow.</p>— Gabe Hudson (@gabehudson) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabehudson/status/1521139749322477569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2022</a>
</blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Creating art seems to be central to the importance of life as far as I can tell.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.arraycast.com/episodes/episode26-stevan-apter" target="blank">
  The most recent episode of ArrayCast with Stevan Apter dipped into this as well when the panelists discussed the aesthetic of writing APL.
</a>
In some ways they were a little reserved about saying they enjoy APL at least in part due to the aesthetic of the language.
I don’t think this is something to shy away from - if we can’t appreciate the beauty of what we do, why are we doing it at all?</p>

<p>I loved working through this rather simple problem.</p>

<p>I loved the process of visualizing the inputs, of thinking through possible solutions while going about my day.</p>

<p>I loved taking my solution to the BQN forum for more gifted and practiced BQN-ers to find far simpler and more elegant solutions than mine.</p>

<p>The whole process felt like writing a poem, and at the end I’m rewarded by sharing this poem with others, seeing what they come up with, and comparing their thoughts with mine.</p>

<p>There is a unique joy and beauty I find in BQN (and APL more broadly), and that’s what keeps me coming back.</p>

<p>As Kurt Vonnegut pointed out, what else could be a more worthwhile way to spend my time?</p>

<p>Please, give it a try, and fall in love with the community while you’re at it.</p>

## C++ Solution

I'll also include my C++ solution for kicks and giggles:

```cpp
void setZeroes(vector<vector<int>>& m) {
  const auto rs = m.size(), cs = m[0].size();
  vector<int> rows, cols;
  for (int i=0; i<rs; i++)
    for (int j=0; j<cs; j++)
      if (0 == m[i][j]) {
        rows.push_back(i);
        cols.push_back(j);
      }
  for (const auto r : rows)
    std::fill(m[r].begin(), m[r].end(), 0);
  for (const auto c : cols)
    for (auto& r : m)
      r[c] = 0;
}
```
