<h2 id="overall-impressions">Overall Impressions</h2>

<p>I was struck by how much more prevalent darker roasts were in Seattle - it was my impression that most specialty espresso was in the lighter range of roasts to bring out more of the differences between varietals.
Almost every shop I visited served a pretty dark and heavy-bodied roast for their espresso, and few places changed their roasts out with the seasons.</p>

<p>I spoke with Collin from Cafe Ladro about the coffee culture in Seattle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were really ahead of our time in the 90s, but most places haven’t been updated since then.
You would probably find fewer shops serving lighter (and better) roasts in a newer place like Portland.
Things are even worse in San Fran - they were killing the game 30 years ago, but if you go now it’s mostly the same stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, there were still some <em>great</em> spots roasting beans in-house.
<strong><em>Cafe Ladro</em></strong> (where I met Collin) and <strong><em>Cafe Vita</em></strong> were wonderful.
<strong><em>Cafe Allegro</em></strong> was a hidden gem I would <em>absolutely</em> swing by again, especially given how close it is to the 1 metro line; I had two coffees with an old friend there before hopping on the 1 to catch my Amtrack back to Portland, but I could have stayed much longer.
<strong><em>The Good Weather Bike &amp; Coffee</em></strong> cafe-and-bike-repair-shop-combo served a really nice Herkimer espresso blend, who roasts their beans a few neighborhoods away.</p>

<p>Collin mentioned Superjoy Roasters in Portland, and though they are on my list I have not stopped by there yet.</p>

<!---
- milstead in freemont
- were ahead of the curve in the 90s haven't really updated 
- san fran is worse than seattle
- collin 
- superjoy
- kurasu roasters from japan

<h2 id="cafe-allegro-8510">Cafe Allegro: 8.5/10</h2>

<p>Hidden in an alleyway in between a used bookstore and a pizza joint, Cafe Allegro had the most enjoyable espresso of any of the cafes I visited in Seattle.
The barista had a t-shirt reading <em>Where the hell is Allegro?</em> paying homage to the cafe’s obscure location.</p>

<p>I felt a sense of relief when I took my first sip of Allegro’s espresso and felt familiar waves of fruit wash over me.
For most of my coffee-drinking life I considered myself more of a dark-roast kinda guy, but since getting more into espresso and going back to darker roasts, I feel like my taste has developed to like well-done lighter roasts far more.</p>

<p>I got notes of berries (strawberries?) and dried fruit.
The listed flavor comps were stone fruit (?) and chocolate.
I didn’t get much of either of those, but I still loved it (and went back for a second).</p>

<p>The barista mentioned a cafe in northern San Fransisco named after the Italian city <em>Trieste</em> after which Cafe Allegro was designed; maybe if my espresso journey takes me that far I’ll give it a try!
Definitely stop by if you have some time near the 1 line in the University District.</p>

<h2 id="cafe-vita-810">Cafe Vita: 8/10</h2>

<p>I had the <em>Cafe del Sol</em>, a house-roasted medium blend.
It was pretty good - the first &gt;=8 score of this Seattle trip.
I experienced medium body, balanced flavor (not nearly as dark as my previous shots) on the nutty side of sweet.
The flavor comps on the bag read <em>milk chocolate, caramel, dark cherry</em>; I mostly got the caramel.</p>

<p>Nothing mind-blowing, but I would have it again.</p>

<h2 id="cafe-ladro-8510">Cafe Ladro: 8.5/10</h2>

<p>This was the first specialty espresso place I got to visit.
I had the Ladro house medium blend with milk chocolate, dark cherry and caramel flavor comps, but the strongest flavors I got were nuttiness/hazelnut and vanilla.
I found a really mild finish, I wasn’t punched in the nose by bitterness or dryness like many of the other shops.</p>

<p>This was a really nice espresso! If you’re in the West Queen Anne area you might want to stop by.</p>

<h2 id="zeitgeist-6510">Zeitgeist: 6.5/10</h2>

<p>This smaller German coffeehouse with aged brick walls was a nice environment and okayish coffee, but wasn’t overly impressive to me.
Unfortunately, they didn’t seem all that busy either - I could see myself coming back if I needed a place to work or if I knew there would be a more busy or upbeat energy, but this was not my favorite place.
I had the Jackson Street Blues roast from Fulcrum Coffee Roasters.</p>

<h2 id="good-weather-bike--coffee-7510">Good Weather Bike &amp; Coffee: 7.5/10</h2>

<p>Good Weather was interesting - the cafe environment was serene, tucked into an alleyway in Capitol Hill near a secondhand sportswear shop.
I was excited to see them serving Herkimer’s espresso blend; I wanted to try these beans from a Herkimer cafe front, but I didn’t get the chance.</p>

<p>I got a lighter body, almost like a black tea and a <em>much</em> lighter roast than some of the other (read: worse) shots I tried this weekend.
I tasted soem chamomile and dried fruits, maybe raisins/craisins.</p>

<h2 id="lighthouse-roasters-710">Lighthouse Roasters: 7/10</h2>

<p>This neighborhood roaster was <em>filled</em> with dogs, and the cafe bar shelved probably a dozen kinds of dog treats.
The roast was too dark for specialty espresso, but I would absolutely have an americano or latte of their house roast.
I get the sense the neighborhood patrons stop by for a coffee and grab a bag of their house roast for their drip machine at home.
An extremely small and cozy shop with maybe 4 small tables right next to the roasters and at least half a dozen bags of green coffee beansready to be processed.</p>

<p>If I lived next to this cafe, I’d probably be drinking far more americano for how enjoyable their cafe environment was.</p>

<h2 id="monorail-espresso-310">Monorail Espresso: 3/10</h2>

<p>The cute window-only cafe front was unfortunately not very good…
Very dry, very dark, HEAVY body.
The smells from the cafe and from my espresso were wonderful (I still <em>love</em> a dark-roast) but my espresso was not very good.
My friend’s vanilla latte was great though!</p>

<h2 id="fonté-210">Fonté: 2/10</h2>

<p>Fonté was unfortunately the first espresso in this entire journey that I could not even finish.
Extremely dark and heavy-bodied, my mouth puckered up with bitterness with both of the sips I could get down.
Very unfortunate.</p>

<p>Thanks to my friend Emma that stuck with me and my annoying coffee flavor charts and endless cafes :)</p>
