# $(whoami)

I am currently an intern with [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/). I am 
primarily in the Data/Research Computing team, but I am also on a project with the National
Security Directorate.

Right now I am pursuing a BS in Math and Computer Science at [Whitworth University](https://www.whitworth.edu/cms/), 
and I expect to graduate in the Spring of '20.
