I am currently an intern with [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/). I am 
primarily in the Data/Research Computing team, but I am also on a project with the National
Security Directorate.

Right now I am pursuing a BS in Math and Computer Science at [Whitworth University](https://www.whitworth.edu/cms/), 
and I expect to graduate in the Spring of '20.

See my [resume](static/personal/resume.pdf) for the short of it.

I got started with software and data science at [Micron Virginia](https://www.micron.com/) the summer 
after my freshman year of college. I started out as an analyst for the finance department, but
soon after discovering my aptitude for software my manager moved me into new projects with the 
software development and data science teams. There I designed and implemented new clustering algorithms
and worked on my first software development team.
