I am currently an intern with [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/). I am 
primarily in the Data/Research Computing team, but I am also on a project with the National
Security Directorate.

Right now I am pursuing a BS in Math and Computer Science at [Eastern Washington University](https://www.ewu.edu/), 
and I expect to graduate in the Spring of '20.

I am passionate about open source software and have had the privilage to contribute to some 
major OSS such as [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and the 
[ElasticSearch Python bindings](https://github.com/ashermancinelli/elasticsearch-py).

See my [resume](static/personal/resume.pdf) for the short of it.

I got started with software and data science at [Micron Virginia](https://www.micron.com/) the summer 
after my freshman year of college. I started out as an analyst for the finance department, but
soon after discovering my aptitude for software my manager moved me into new projects with the 
software development and data science teams. There I designed and implemented new clustering algorithms
and worked on my first software development team.

Since May of '18 I have been working at [PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/). Here's a few highlights:
- Created a fully convolutional OCR network
- Created time-series model using Gaussian Processes for engineering team to predict energy consumption
- Developed various web apps for visualizing and analyzing large datasets

- I was asked to give a presentation on TensorFlow and neural networks, which is available online [here](fullstacktc.org/user/amancinelli).
- My greatest passion is probably working with the homeless and food-insecure. I started a group at Whitworth which visits and feeds homeless and food-insecure people in downtown Spokane, and that is one of my greatest joys. 
- I Played varsity baseball at Whitworth University for my freshman/sophomore years.
- I am a leader of several outreach groups on campus and in my community.
- I have been on three mission trips to Haiti.
- I love to experiment with different technologies I am unfamiliar with, like DevOps techs and new programming languages (especially functional ones).
