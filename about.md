Hello! I want to make computing fun and accessible.

<hr>

As the Software Stack Thrust Lead for [ExaSGD](https://www.exascaleproject.org/research-project/exasgd/) (member of the US Dept. of Energy Exascale Computing Project),
I have the opportunity to lead a diverse and distributed team of domain
scientists and engineers towards our goal of modeling the United States
power grid on the most powerful computers in history for emergency scenarios.
We develop extremely large and high-quality codebases to leverage new
developments in scientific domains targeting computing environments that have
not been built yet.

I am also a member of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Research Computing
division, where I develop our institutional computing infrastructure to support
the computational goals of the institution, particularly those related to large,
scalable deep learning.

### Interests

- Upcoming C++ features, modern C, CMake
- Developer tooling and packaging
- Portable codebases targeting CUDA, HIP, OpenMP and other hardware acceleration platforms
- Linux systems programming
- Distributed computing
- Compilers
