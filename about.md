Hello! I am passionate about leveraging high performance computing systems to gain meaningful insight.

As the Software Stack Thrust Lead for ExaSGD (member of the US Dept. of Energy Exascale Computing Project), I have the opportunity to lead a diverse and distributed team of domain scientists and engineers towards our goal of modeling the United States power grid on the most powerful computers in history for emergency scenarios. We develop extremely large and high-quality codebases to leverage new developments in scientific domains targeting computing environments that have not been built yet.

I am also a member of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Research Computing division, where I develop our institutional computing infrastructure to support the computational goals of the institution, particularly those related to large, scalable deep learning.

I'm honored to have the opportunity to contribute so directly to my society, as well the historied field of high performance computing.

Interests:
- Modern C++(11/14/17), C11, CMake
- Portable codebases targeting CUDA, HIP, and other hardware acceleration platforms
- Linux systems programming
- Distributed computing
- Compilers
