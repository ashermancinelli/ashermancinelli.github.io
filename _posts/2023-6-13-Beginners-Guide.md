Espresso should be fun! Don't be intimidated by all the lingo.

⚠️  Post still under development ⚠️

<em>NOTE: This is not about how to <strong>make</strong> espresso - just getting a feel for the lingo and culture, hopefully increasing your enjoyment of the drink and specialty shops that serve it.</em>

## What is Espresso?

## Lingo

### Roasts

aka darkness of the roast

### Processes

#### Honey
#### Water
#### Dry

## Flavor Comps

You might see a tab on a bag of coffee that says *"Tastes like: chocolate, hazelnut, cherry"*.
Don't be intimidated if you've never thought to yourself *"Wow, this coffee tastes like chocolate!"*; these flavor comparison notes are just to give you an idea of what you're getting into, and you might not notice these notes until you've tried several coffees side-by-side to see how these notes come through.
It's perfectly fine to enjoy coffee without thinking about the flavor any more than *"Yep! This tastes like coffee."*

## Beans

### Varietals
### Farmers
