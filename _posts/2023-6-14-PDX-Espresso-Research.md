All the Portland espresso recomendations I could find online, and the shops that keep coming up.

# My Takeaways

The most common names in these blogs are probably:

1. Coava
1. Proud Mary
1. Case Study
1. Heart
1. Stumptown

If you visit any given cafe in Portland, chances are high their beans come from either Heart, Coava or Proud Mary, and for good reason.
All three of them are local and put out some *solid* roasts... but I still recommend finding some smaller shops that still roast in-house.

In my opinion, the most underrated cafes and roasters are probably:

1. Deadstock
1. Courier

and the most overrated are:

1. Stumptown
1. Case Study
1. Never Coffee (unless you really like lattes)
1. PUSH X PULL
