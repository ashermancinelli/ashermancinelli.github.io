I've tried (and liked) almost all of *Oregon Obsessed*'s recomendations, though a few are overrated in my opinion:

1. Good Coffee
1. Stumptown
1. Case Study
1. Nossa Familia
1. Proud Mary
1. Deadstock
1. Never Coffee
1. Ovation
1. Portland Coffee Roasters

## [Daily Hive](https://dailyhive.com/portland/best-coffee-shops-portland)

Good to see *Coava* consistently topping these lists - hadn't heard of Pájaro either.

This list is focused on *cafes* and not really *coffee*... there were some names on this list I hadn't seen before, so I'll keep it around... but I wouldn't put much weight on these names (hence why it comes last in my research page).
