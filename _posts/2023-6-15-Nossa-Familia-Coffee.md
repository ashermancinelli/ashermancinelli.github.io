Delicious, well-balanced, predominantly Brazilian roasts and espresso.

---

I've had espresso from Nossa before at their northern location in the Pearl where I had one of their in-house roasts, but when I stopped by for this review they had a roast from Keia & Martyn's Coffee roasters (also based out of Portland).
This black-owned roaster was featured in the SE Nossa cafe I visited for the month of June (I'll just have to revisit when they have their own roasts on espressoðŸ˜‰).

The Colombian Yeny Capiz roast from Keia & Martyn's *radical* line had flavor comps of molasses, sweet red tea, citrus, and candied hazelnut, though I didn't get much of the citrus.
My coffee tasted balanced, nutty, and a bit sweet; the molasses and candied hazelnut came through pretty clearly to me.

Augusto Carneiro started Nossa to bring his family's coffee to Portland from Brazil, and the shop continues to pride itself on the farmer-roaster relationships they have with all of their growers, which now come from Guatemala, Nicaragua, Peru, Ethiopia as well.

My coffee was solid: well-rounded, tasty, not overpowering.
It didn't show up Courier or Sterling, but it was also clearly in the top echelon of coffees I've had in the city.
