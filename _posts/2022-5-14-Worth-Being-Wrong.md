What is worth living for? How much of my life should be spent to figuring out what's technically correct when I could be using my time to help the material conditions of my neighbor?

# What's Worth Being Wrong About?

I was given a set of ideas to see the world through, a toolbox for interacting with ideas and experiences.
This toolbox fell short a long time ago for many reasons which won't be enumerated here.

The castle of ideas was built up in my mind over many years, and in a few short years I tore many of those walls down.
Since then, I've been rebuilding, reconstructing, tearing down again, and rebuilding some more.
I guess this is just a dialectic - not all that special.

I only have so much time and energy in this life, and I can keep building and tearing down again, or I can lift my eyes to the material conditions of my neighbors.
At some point, sorting out my philosophy became less of a priority.

There must come a point where I'm comfortable working with the castle I've built, otherwise I'll keep adding a brick here, breaking another there, and one day I'll look around me and realize I'm in a half-built castle in a field of half-built castles, and I could have joined my neighbor in their half-built castle years ago.

# A Process God?

Tripp Fuller has been instrumental in my philisophical and religious development, and is likely a large reason I still consider myself christian.

He gives me hope.

Tyson does too.

There are few of them, but their words go so far.

When I consider the God I encounter in Jesus, I think of the christian god of process theology, at least as I understand it.
If all experience that has ever been experienced were rolled up into one being, what would that being have to say?
Let's call that being god.

> What would God say to you?

> If God were to walk among us, who would God become?

> Who would that God shape us to be?

# Could He Have Been Wrong?

John Dominic Crosson's picture of Jesus is compelling to me - we can't look back at how 1st c people talked about Ceasar and not apply those same rules to Jesus.
If we talk about Ceasar being a god, we can talk about Jesus being God.
If we look at the Romans and consider their notion of Ceasar's godhood as mythology, we must apply the same reasoning to Jesus.

This doesn't discount the story of Jesus however.

## Mythology as Reality

The myth of Jesus has shaped all of reality to a staggering degree.
Myths shape reality more than factual information, and if that doesn't ring true to you, you're not paying attention.
