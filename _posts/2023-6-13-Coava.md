The first Portland coffee shop I fell in love with.

When I first moved to Portland, there was a Coava cafe in the same building as my apartment, on the lobby floor.
I worked from that cafe in the upstairs seating area surrounded by Monstera Deliciosas, PSU students, and speakers playing indi tracks I'd never heard before.

Coava espresso is the espresso I've consumed the most of in my life by a long shot.
It's no surprise that it gets a perfect 10/10; fruity but not too blond, bitter but not too dark.

I'll forever mourn their west-side location, but their headquarters shop on SE Main and Grand is a much nicer cafe anyways.
The seating area is home to beautiful woodworking projects from *Bamboo Revolution* with whom Coava shares a space, along with antique roasting equipment and open-air garage doors and fans (at least in the summer time).

For this review I had a doppio of the *Java Papatong*, a washed-process bean from Indonesia, but I've loved many of their other roasts:

- the San Marcos,
- the SO Blend from the Americas and East Africa,
- the Darfusu washed process,
- the Fazenda Serra do Bon√© from Brazil,

and plenty of others. Their roasts are all seasonal, so try whatever they have.
