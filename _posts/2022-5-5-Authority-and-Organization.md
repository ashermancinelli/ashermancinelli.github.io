Reflections on authority, particularly contrasting implicit and explicit authority.

## üçΩ Setting the Stage

Let us consider *Organization X*, a mutual aid collective and with the goal of improving the material conditions of the working class in their context.
The primary form of organization is through informal and unofficial communication between members, inspired by 19th century Anarchism, particularly Mutualism, Bakuninists, and the First International.

X may reflect organisational beliefs such as:

> Instead of relying on the state, society should be organised by individuals entering into voluntary agreements with each other on a basis of equality and reciprocity.
>
> - Nicolas Walter, *About Anarchism*[6], p25

As expanded upon in libcom.org's article on *Anarcho-Communism*[7], this mix of beliefs may be summarized as *the free association of producers and consumers*.

The key difference between X and the visions laid out by Bakunin, Malatesta, and their colleagues in the First International is that X ***does not have capacity for collective decision making***.

A key feature of this organization is that many decisions are made in subgroups of X and disseminated ad-hoc to the rest of the members.
These subgroups are unelected and not subject to application nor accountability.

## üëì Through a Cybernetic Lens

In examining the prevalence of implicit authority and decision making through the lens of Stafford Beer's Viable System Model (VSM), I came away with one key insight:

> Absence of explicit decision-making is not the ***absence of response*** to environmental stimuli, but the absence of a ***coordinated*** and ***effective*** response.

### üîé Problem Formulation

For any organization to perpetuate its own existence, it must react to its environment.
By virtue of X's continued existence, it is, by definition, responding to its environment in some manner.
Should there be no collectively agreed-upon actions in response to stimuli, by Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety[10], a variety of responses equivalent to the stimuli are *still produced by the organization*.
Organization X, being relatively large, has a large degree of incoming stimuli and therefor a large degree of response stimuli.
Where, then, do the variety of responses come from if not from an official stance (whether voted on or handed down from leadership)?

The only source of response variety is the individual facing the variety.

Say a member of X is approached by a representative of organization Y, whose platform has about a 50% overlap with the (implicit) platform of X.
Members of Y would like to collaborate with members of X on a particular event.
This introduces environmental variety to the viable system of organization X.
The system 1 of X is now functionally the individual member approached by the member of Y, as this member is the only one able to respond to stimuli, given that voting and collective decision-making are off the table.
Because there is no organizational capacity to perform operations of systems 2 and 3, the individual must also take on these functions and respond according to their own perceptions of organization Y.

System 3 coordinates between systems 1 and 2 and directions reactions to the environment.
In this case, the individual member of X is performing operations of systems 1, 2, and 3 for organization X whether other members of X would support or consent to those actions if they knew about them.
This introduces a sort of tyranny over all members of X - they are cut off from any decision-making about the direction of X.
Over time, many of these small interactions accumulate to form the long-term personality and character of X, meaning that individual members of X are performing system 4 and 5 operations as well - all without the consent and support of the majority of the members of X.

### üôã Subgroups

Another drawback of the decision-making power of the unelected subgroups of X is the disconnect between the entirety of the membership of X and the subgroups, which are able to perform functions of systems 3-5.
Because the subgroups are unofficial and not accountable to the entirety of the membership of X, they cannot effectively take into account the stimuli being fed into X by the environment.

The members of X act as systems 1 whenever they perform mutual aid or talk with non-members: they intake stimuli from the environment and elicit some response.
However because the subgroups are making decisions as systems 3 without direct input from the various systems 1 (the members), organization X is *provably* unable to make informed decisions in response to the environment - they are not accounting for all of the input variety, and therefore are not responding in like variety.

### üè´ Collective Decision-Making

Without a mechanism for X to make decisions about its members behavior and the organization's platform, total control of the organization is given not to the individuals the comprise organization, but to the circumstances in which members of X are presented with environmental stimuli.
In those circumstances, without the consent or support of the organization, functions of systems 1 through 5 are all performed - the character of X is left to chance.

Let the reader note that this is not in the spirit of the 19th century political theorists that inspire X - in the free association of producers and consumers, the most common organization of decision making is by direct democracy and occasional representation subject to instant recall:

> ...[non anarchists] are sure that anarchy means order which arises spontaneously and that anarchists do not want organisation.
> This is the reverse of the truth.
> Anarchists actually want much more organisation, though organisation without authority...
> A moment's thought will show that when compulsion is replaced by consent there will hav eto be more discussion and planning, not less.
> Everyone who is involved in a decision will be able to take part in making it... every decision will be made afresh.
>
> - Nicolas Walter, *About Anarchism*[6], p12

It is intrinsic to the spirit of anarchism that members of an organization partake consensually, something not possible in X the way it is presently structured.
The history of anarchist organization is rich with examples of communes, collectives, councils, and other structures.
The common thread is consensual participation and individual representation.

What historical examples can be applied to X?

## üìñ Differences Between X and Successful Predecessors

Organizational strategies of some societies in which 19th century Anarchism was most successfully applied are contrasted with that of organization X below.

### Rojava

In Rojava, citizens are reprented directly in neighborhood councils, and vote for instantly-recallable representatives to attend city and regional councils to form policy in larger health, defence, economic, and education committees (*The Communes of Rojava*[12] at 1:30).

The smallest unit of democracy is direct, and higher-level policy is formed through representative democracy.

### Spanish Revolution

### Paris Commune
