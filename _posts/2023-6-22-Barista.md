Solid option in NW Portland with a variety of local roasts, not just their own.

---

I had the spirit lifter blend from Puff roasters, which was unfortunately out of stock in the consumer-sized bags, so I was unable to see the actual roast level, flavor comps, etc.
It tasted like a medium roast with some very mild sweetness, almost like a vanilla tea; very clear, very light body.

They had two other roasts on espresso; this is a thoughtful cafe with interesting roasts.
I plan on returning to rate all three roasts they have available, and I'll keep my eyes on what new roasts they bring into the shop.

Although they roast their own coffee, they also bring in beans from other local roasters.
Sourcing and serving the best local beans is their mission statement, as listed on their website.
