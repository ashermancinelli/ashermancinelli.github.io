Pleasant, mild, unique, imported roasts from Sweden - try some beans you'll likely not find anywhere else!

---

The first thing I look for when I walk into a new cafe in the Portland area is the coffee bags the shop is selling:

> Are they using Coava or Proud Mary beans? Do they roast their own? Am I trying something new today, or maybe an old favorite?

Walking into Adapt Cafe in SE, I was surprised to see bags I'd not seen before - light and modern packaging around small, 250 gram bags from *Morgon Coffee Roasters* from Gothenburg, Sweden.

The swedish beans bled out into the design language of the shop - smallish seating area with huge windows and modern-feeling all-black furnishing against white walls.
The barista was happy to tell me about the imported roasts from the *very* young 5-year-old roasting company they buy from, and the rapid pace at which they have been winning awards:

> Our combined resume contains... competing in most things coffee.
> Some of those competitions resulted in a ***bronze in roasting, two silvers in brewing and two gold medals in coffee tasting***. 
>
> In 2020 we had our first prize spotlight for Morgon when we were ***finalists in the 12th annual international Sprudgie’s award as “Most notable roaster in 2020”***.

I found the espresso to be very pleasant, on the mild side - the primary flavor comp I experienced was *plum*; a touch of sweetness and sourness, but not really any citrus *per se*, and certainly not much bitterness.
After the first sip, I couldn't tell if it was more sour or bitter.
It wasn't until the second and third sip that I made up my mind; that's how subtle it was.
The other flavor comps were structured, chocolate, and bisuit, but I could only really pick up notes of plum.

I had their honey process Costa Rican beans of the [Catuai variety of Arabica](https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/varieties/catuai) from the Montero family - at first I thought *Montero* might have been referring to a coffee *variety* I'd not yet heard of, but no: these beans were *grown* by the Montero family, and [Morgon's website has a whole page about their relationship with the Montero family](https://www.morgoncoffeeroasters.com/products/carlos-montero-costa-rica-tarrazu).
Carlos Montero even visited Morgon in Gothenburg to see their roasting operation.

For being a dark-roast kinda guy, I *really* enjoyed their espresso.
It's obvious they care about coffee, their baristas are knoledgable, and they get their beans from a *serious* roasting company.
I would love to see more Morgon beans around town, maybe even in a second Adapt Cafe location.
I think they would get a lot of business in a more central location, though I do enjoy how many local roasters get the spotlight in cafes downtown.
