BQN and Julia battle to the death!

{% include disclaimer.html %}

## Why?

Raz (@miguelraz_ on Twitter) suggested we work through some problems in BQN and Julia, each in the language we know less about, guiding each other through the problems.

## BQN

In our first call, Raz and I went through a couple BQN primitives to get him started with the language.
These are my notes from getting him set up:

```
   3‿3⥊↕10 # set up a matrix
┌─
╵ 0 1 2
  3 4 5
  6 7 8
        ┘
   ⌽3‿3⥊↕10 # reverse it
┌─
╵ 6 7 8
  3 4 5
  0 1 2
        ┘

   # transpose it and marvel at the
   # relationship between the ⌽ and ⍉ glyphs
   ⍉3‿3⥊↕10 
┌─
╵ 0 3 6
  1 4 7
  2 5 8
        ┘
```

When looking at the keyboard in the JS repl, it's helpful to note that:

* Functions are in green
* 1 Mod are in purple/pink
* 2 Mod are in yellow

Try to get a good feel for ¨, ⌜, and ´ as these are oft-used modifiers.

Note also that the following glyphs are special: `𝕤𝕩𝕨𝕣𝕗𝕘`.
These have special meaning inside function and modifier blocks.
For example:

```
   _Hi_←{(𝕨𝔽𝕩)+(𝕨𝔾𝕩)}
(2-modifier block)
   5 + _Hi_ × 3
23
```

Within the `_Hi_` block:
```
𝕤←{(𝕨+𝕩)+(𝕨×𝕩)}
𝕨←5
𝕩←3
𝕣←{(𝕨𝔽𝕩)+(𝕨𝔾𝕩)}
𝔽←+
𝔾←×
```
