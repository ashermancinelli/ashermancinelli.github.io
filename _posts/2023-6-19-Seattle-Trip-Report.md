## Overall Impressions

I was struck by how much more prevalent darker roasts were in Seattle - it was my impression that most specialty espresso was in the lighter range of roasts to bring out more of the differences between varietals.
Almost every shop I visited served a pretty dark and heavy-bodied roast for their espresso, and few places changed their roasts out with the seasons.

I spoke with Collin from Cafe Ladro about the coffee culture in Seattle:

> We were really ahead of our time in the 90s, but most places haven't been updated since then.
> You would probably find fewer shops serving lighter (and better) roasts in a newer place like Portland.
> Things are even worse in San Fran - they were killing the game 30 years ago, but if you go now it's mostly the same stuff.

That being said, there were still some *great* spots roasting beans in-house.
***Cafe Ladro*** (where I met Collin) and ***Cafe Vita*** were wonderful.
***Cafe Allegro*** was a hidden gem I would *absolutely* swing by again, especially given how close it is to the 1 metro line; I had two coffees with an old friend there before hopping on the 1 to catch my Amtrack back to Portland, but I could have stayed much longer.
***The Good Weather Bike & Coffee*** cafe-and-bike-repair-shop-combo served a really nice Herkimer espresso blend, who roasts their beans a few neighborhoods away.


Collin mentioned Superjoy Roasters in Portland, and though they are on my list I have not stopped by there yet.

## Cafe Allegro: 8.5/10

Hidden in an alleyway in between a used bookstore and a pizza joint, Cafe Allegro had the most enjoyable espresso of any of the cafes I visited in Seattle.
The barista had a t-shirt reading *Where the hell is Allegro?* paying homage to the cafe's obscure location.

I felt a sense of relief when I took my first sip of Allegro's espresso and felt familiar waves of fruit wash over me.
For most of my coffee-drinking life I considered myself more of a dark-roast kinda guy, but since getting more into espresso and going back to darker roasts, I feel like my taste has developed to like well-done lighter roasts far more.

I got notes of berries (strawberries?) and dried fruit.
The listed flavor comps were stone fruit (?) and chocolate.
I didn't get much of either of those, but I still loved it (and went back for a second).

The barista mentioned a cafe in northern San Fransisco named after the Italian city *Trieste* after which Cafe Allegro was designed; maybe if my espresso journey takes me that far I'll give it a try!
Definitely stop by if you have some time near the 1 line in the University District.

## Cafe Vita: 8/10

I had the *Cafe del Sol*, a house-roasted medium blend.
It was pretty good - the first >=8 score of this Seattle trip.
I experienced medium body, balanced flavor (not nearly as dark as my previous shots) on the nutty side of sweet.
The flavor comps on the bag read *milk chocolate, caramel, dark cherry*; I mostly got the caramel.

Nothing mind-blowing, but I would have it again.

## Cafe Ladro: 8.5/10

This was the first specialty espresso place I got to visit.
I had the Ladro house medium blend with milk chocolate, dark cherry and caramel flavor comps, but the strongest flavors I got were nuttiness/hazelnut and vanilla.
I found a really mild finish, I wasn't punched in the nose by bitterness or dryness like many of the other shops.

This was a really nice espresso! If you're in the West Queen Anne area you might want to stop by.

## Zeitgeist: 6.5/10

This smaller German coffeehouse with aged brick walls was a nice environment and okayish coffee, but wasn't overly impressive to me.
Unfortunately, they didn't seem all that busy either - I could see myself coming back if I needed a place to work or if I knew there would be a more busy or upbeat energy, but this was not my favorite place.
I had the Jackson Street Blues roast from Fulcrum Coffee Roasters.

## Good Weather Bike & Coffee: 7.5/10

Good Weather was interesting - the cafe environment was serene, tucked into an alleyway in Capitol Hill near a secondhand sportswear shop.
I was excited to see them serving Herkimer's espresso blend; I wanted to try these beans from a Herkimer cafe front, but I didn't get the chance.

I got a lighter body, almost like a black tea and a *much* lighter roast than some of the other (read: worse) shots I tried this weekend.
I tasted soem chamomile and dried fruits, maybe raisins/craisins.

## Lighthouse Roasters: 7/10

This neighborhood roaster was *filled* with dogs, and the cafe bar shelved probably a dozen kinds of dog treats.
The roast was too dark for specialty espresso, but I would absolutely have an americano or latte of their house roast.
I get the sense the neighborhood patrons stop by for a coffee and grab a bag of their house roast for their drip machine at home.
An extremely small and cozy shop with maybe 4 small tables right next to the roasters and at least half a dozen bags of green coffee beansready to be processed.

If I lived next to this cafe, I'd probably be drinking far more americano for how enjoyable their cafe environment was.

## Monorail Espresso: 3/10

The cute window-only cafe front was unfortunately not very good...
Very dry, very dark, HEAVY body.
The smells from the cafe and from my espresso were wonderful (I still *love* a dark-roast) but my espresso was not very good.
My friend's vanilla latte was great though!

## Fonté: 2/10

Fonté was unfortunately the first espresso in this entire journey that I could not even finish.
Extremely dark and heavy-bodied, my mouth puckered up with bitterness with both of the sips I could get down.
Very unfortunate.

Thanks to my friend Emma that stuck with me and my annoying coffee flavor charts and endless cafes :)
