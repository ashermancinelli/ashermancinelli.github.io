All the shops and roasters I tried while visiting my friend in Seattle!

## Overall Impressions

I was struck by how much more prevalent darker roasts were in Seattle - it was my impression that most specialty espresso was in the lighter range of roasts to bring out more of the differences between varietals.
Almost every shop I visited served a pretty dark and heavy-bodied roast for their espresso, and few places changed their roasts out with the seasons.

I spoke with Collin from Cafe Ladro about the coffee culture in Seattle:

> We were really ahead of our time in the 90s, but most places haven't been updated since then.
> You would probably find fewer shops serving lighter (and better) roasts in a newer place like Portland.
> Things are even worse in San Fran - they were killing the game 30 years ago, but if you go now it's mostly the same stuff.

That being said, there were still some *great* spots roasting beans in-house.
Cafe Ladro (where I met Collin) and Cafe Vita were wonderful.
The Good Weather Bike & Coffee cafe-and-bike-repair-shop-combo served a really nice Herkimer espresso blend, who roasts their beans a few neighborhoods away.


Collin mentioned Superjoy roasters in Portland, and I haven't stopped by there yet.

## Cafe Vita: 8/10
## Cafe Ladro: 8.5/10
## Zeitgeist: 6.5/10
## Good Weather Bike & Coffee: 7/10
## Lighthouse Roasters: 7/10
## Monorail Espresso: 3/10

The cute window-only cafe front was unfortunately not very good...
Very dry, very dark, HEAVY body.
The smells from the cafe and from my espresso were wonderful (I still *love* a dark-roast) but my espresso was not very good.
My friend's vanilla latte was great though!

## Fonté: 2/10

Fonté was unfortunately the first espresso in this entire journey that I could not even finish.
Extremely dark and heavy-bodied, my mouth puckered up with bitterness with both of the sips I could get down.
Very unfortunate.

Thanks to my friend Emma that stuck with me and my annoying coffee flavor charts and endless cafes :)
