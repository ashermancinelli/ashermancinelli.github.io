  <h1>Common Platform on Abortion Rights</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Reflections on the common ground between several organiztions with respect to the class struggle for abortion rights.</p>

<h2 id="-organized-labor-for-abortion-rights-">üõ† Organized Labor for Abortion Rights ‚úä</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs my impression that the common ground between all involved organizations is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We must organize our labor to win abortion rights and bodily autonomy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This involves organized labor in some form (likely a labor union with directly democratic principles) demanding abortion and healthcare rights to their constituency through the withholding of labor and class solidarity.</p>

<h2 id="demonstration-of-common-ground">Demonstration of Common Ground</h2>

<p>The following sections demonstrate the support for this common platform based on the official or unofficial programs of each (potentially) involved organization.</p>

<h3 id="iar">IAR</h3>

<p>The IAR position is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Idaho Abortions Rights is a community of people who are seeking social change around the topic of abortion access in the state of Idaho.</p>

  <p>We believe that all people deserve access to legal, safe abortions including people who are BIPOC LGBTQ+ Disabled and live in rural areas. 
We believe that healthcare is a human right
We believe all people need comprehensive sex education and birth control access.</p>

  <p>Our mission to be a resource to the community and to speak up as an advocate for people seeking legal, safe abortions</p>

  <p>Restrictions on abortions cause death to people and loss of bodily autonomy.</p>

  <p>We know that our diverse perspectives make us stronger and we will continue to host demonstrations to bring this issue to the forefront and into the minds of our Idaho neighbors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IAR is a nonprofit, and thus has some restrictions on what positions it is allowed to take on.
IAR shares the position that this struggle for abortion rights is a class struggle, and that organized labor is the most effective strategy currently at our disposal to win abortion rights.</p>

<h3 id="rr">RR</h3>

<p>Point II of the Red Republican‚Äôs Program is as follows[1]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We push for uncompromising commitments to a bill of rights, economic rights, workers‚Äô rights, and the privacy and security of working people today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This includes free and universal healthcare (subpoint 1a of [1]).
There is no official statement in their program related to abortion rights, however from discussing this with RR representatives, abortions rights seems to fall directly into their program under 1a of [1].</p>

<h3>üè¥</h3>

<p>One of the first groups to grow out of philosophical anarchism was <em>anarcho-syndicalism</em>, and was particularly popular and influencial in the mid to late 19th century around the time of the First International:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most anarchist collectivists and many communists during the nineteenth century were syndicalists by implication, and this was particularly true of the anarchists in the First International.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>About Anarchism[4], p30</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Syndicalism may be summarized as <em>trade unionism</em>, which when translated to French, reads <em>syndicalisme</em>.</p>

<p>The WSM[6], a more contemporary Irish anarchist organization took the following position in their abortion rights position paper[5]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The WSM stands for people having control over their own bodies: bodily autonomy. Part of that is control over our own reproductive health, including the ability to end a pregnancy if we choose to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="psl">PSL</h3>

<p>Bullet 2 of the <em>Socialism</em> section of part II of the DSA‚Äôs program[3] reads as follows (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It will be a right of every person in the United States to have a job with <strong><em>guaranteed union representation</em></strong> and full social benefits provided by the socialist government, including a pension, <strong><em>health care</em></strong>, workers‚Äô compensation, paid parental and family leave for up to two years, paid sick and disability leave, a minimum of one month‚Äôs paid vacation, and at least 12 paid holidays.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The PSL‚Äôs petition for the legalization of abortion rights reads as follows[2]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rich women have always had access to abortion; it is poor and working class women who stand to lose this fundamental right‚Ä¶ 
Abortion bans are an attack on the rights of working class women‚Ä¶ History shows that progressive legislation is won through struggle. We need a miltant national women‚Äôs rights movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the <em>national</em> component of the labor struggle for abortion rights does not fall into the common platform established by this document, the PSL official does support <em>a</em> labor struggle for abortion rights.
The labor struggle for abortion rights in this document is not specifically national or local or non-heirarchical for this reason.</p>
