<hr />

<p>The first thing to draw me in to a coffee shop is usually the smells - pastries, coffee, and maybe the nutty wooden smell of roasting if I‚Äôm lucky enough to be in a roastery.</p>

<p>Walking into Rose City Coffee however, I was struck by the dark cherry-wood and soft-touch-textured metal furnishing, the brick walls, and the wide-open cafe space - there are no walls or furniture to obstruct your view of one side of the cafe from the other, combining with the floor-to-celeing windows to make the space feel larger than it is.</p>

<hr />

<p>I had the <em>Floribunda</em>, a medium blend with chocolate and floral flavor comps‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs about all I could find about the roast between asking in the shop and looking online.
This is obviously not an espresso specialty shop, but my doppio was still alright.</p>

<p>I got quite a bit of sourness up front, without much darkness or bitterness to balance it out.
If you‚Äôre a fiend for blonde roasts, this would be a pretty fun place to stop - but the menu seems to emphasize lattes, so I don‚Äôt know that I would recommend this spot to a huge fan of blonde <em>espresso</em>.</p>

<p><em>Personally</em>, I would have loved a darker roast and a <em>LOT</em> more information about the beans, but espresso isn‚Äôt every shop‚Äôs emphasis, and that‚Äôs alright too.
Their food options looked (and smelled) amazing as well.</p>

<p>Rose City will live in my head as the place to go if I need to stay put somewhere for all day - great food, decent coffee, and a free-feeling space that I could spend a whole workday at.</p>

<hr />

<p>On top of the food, coffee, and environment, the friend that recommended this place to me remarked that they have live music on Saturdays!
The community events add to Rose City‚Äôs vibe, which leaves it feeling remarkably like the Flying M coffee shop in the Boise, Idaho area, my all-around favorite shop from my time living there.</p>

<p>The Flying M will always have a special place in my heart, so I can‚Äôt help but feel sentimental cracking open my laptop to get some work done in the refreshing Rose City seating area.
It‚Äôs worth stopping by if you‚Äôre in the SE part of the city (especially on a Saturday üòä).</p>

<hr />

<p>The first thing I look for when I walk into a new cafe in the Portland area is the coffee bags the shop is selling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are they using Coava or Proud Mary beans? Do they roast their own? Am I trying something new today, or maybe an old favorite?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Walking into Adapt Cafe in SE, I was surprised to see bags I‚Äôd not seen before - light and modern packaging around small, 250 gram bags from <em>Morgon Coffee Roasters</em> from Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>

<p>The swedish beans bled out into the design language of the shop - smallish seating area with huge windows and modern-feeling all-black furnishing against white walls.
The barista was happy to tell me about the imported roasts from the <em>very</em> young 5-year-old roasting company they buy from, and the rapid pace at which they have been winning awards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our combined resume contains‚Ä¶ competing in most things coffee.
Some of those competitions resulted in a <strong><em>bronze in roasting, two silvers in brewing and two gold medals in coffee tasting</em></strong>.</p>

  <p>In 2020 we had our first prize spotlight for Morgon when we were <strong><em>finalists in the 12th annual international Sprudgie‚Äôs award as ‚ÄúMost notable roaster in 2020‚Äù</em></strong>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Morgon Coffee Roasters‚Äô ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page, see links below</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>I found the espresso to be very pleasant, on the mild side - the primary flavor comp I experienced was <em>plum</em>; a touch of sweetness and sourness, but not really any citrus <em>per se</em>, and certainly not much bitterness.
After the first sip, I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was more sour or bitter.
It wasn‚Äôt until the second and third sip that I made up my mind; that‚Äôs how subtle it was.
The other flavor comps were structured, chocolate, and bisuit, but I could only really pick up notes of plum.</p>

<p>I had their honey process Costa Rican beans of the <a href="https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/varieties/catuai">Catuai variety of Arabica</a> from the Montero family - at first I thought <em>Montero</em> might have been referring to a coffee <em>variety</em> I‚Äôd not yet heard of, but no: these beans were <em>grown</em> by the Montero family, and <a href="https://www.morgoncoffeeroasters.com/products/carlos-montero-costa-rica-tarrazu">Morgon‚Äôs website has a whole page about their relationship with the Montero family</a>.
Carlos Montero even visited Morgon in Gothenburg to see their roasting operation.</p>

<p>For being a dark-roast kinda guy, I <em>really</em> enjoyed their espresso.
It‚Äôs obvious they care about coffee, their baristas are knoledgable, and they get their beans from a <em>serious</em> roasting company.
I would love to see more Morgon beans around town, maybe even in a second Adapt Cafe location.
I think they would get a lot of business in a more central location, though I do enjoy how many local roasters get the spotlight in cafes downtown.</p>

<hr />

<p>Prior to trying Sterling‚Äôs espresso, the #1 on my list was from Courier Coffee.
When I told the barista at Courier how much I enjoyed their espresso, he made sure to recommend Sterling for my next stop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, you like espresso? Yeah, you should definitely check out Sterling</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He backed that comment up with a few more remarks about how special their espresso is, and it went to the top of my list of places to try next.
It did not dissapoint.</p>

<hr />

<p>The barista was excited to welcome me in and tell me all about the roast they had ready for espresso, which happened to be the <em>Nigusse Lemma</em>, a natural-process small-batch Ethiopian roast with Etheopian Heriloom varietals.
I got the same feelings I get trying a new whiskey at the Scotch Lounge on the East side of town - she talked through the roasting process at their East-side roastery and the origins of the beans.</p>

<p>After pulling the shot, she put together a board with a small glass of sparkling water as a pallate clenser (as is usual in espresso-focused cafes).</p>

<p>Adding to the Scotch Lounge feelings, the espresso was served in a glencairn-style whiskey serving glass along with a third glass with a drip brew so as to try the roast from another perspective.</p>

<p>Both coffees were smooth and creamy - I jotted down <em>notes of strawberries and cream</em> before I even saw <em>‚ÄúRaspberry &amp; Vanilla Cream‚Äù</em> listed as flavor comps on the bag of coffee they used for my espresso.</p>

<hr />

<p>This espresso struck me as <strong><em>perfectly balanced</em></strong> - without hesitation, I wanted to share it with every one of my friends still not won over by espresso.
In my experience, when people try espresso and decide they hate it, 95% of the time it‚Äôs due to the intensity of the flavors, especially with sour and bitter notes.
When I try an intense espresso, something that punches you in the mouth with sourness or fruit or bitterness or chocolate or nuttiness, I can enjoy the intensity (if it‚Äôs done well!) - but that seems to be the attribute of espresso that puts people off of it.</p>

<p>This espresso was not intense in the usual way, but not too mild either.
It was full of flavor with delicious notes of citrus, cream, a balance of bitterness to round out the flavor profile, yet not too intense to be someone‚Äôs first espresso.</p>

<p>This espresso, along with their drip brew, the knowledgable baristas, and a cozy cafe seating area nestled into NW Portland with indoor trees and fast wifi brings this to the top of my list.</p>

<p>As I work out an espresso tour of Portland, I <em>have</em> to pencil Sterling in as the final destination.
I would want any espresso afficionado visiting the city to finish their time here with a Sterling espresso.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nestled in central Chinatown, this cafe front for a roastery has their own streetwear line and feels like a trap-house recording studio.
Self-termed <strong><em>Portland‚Äôs Hype Barista</em></strong>, Nike Jordan 1s are hung up everywhere and trap plays over the speakers all day.</p>

<p>The <em>BREEZY Don Enrique</em> Colombian single-origin medium roast was <em>seriously</em> good.
As soon as I finish making this espresso tour, I plan on coming back here to buy a bag or two of the BREEZY - it was one of the best-smelling roasts I‚Äôve come across in the last year.</p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt seen DEADSTOCK mentioned on many blogs, which feels like an injustice.
Definitely worth stopping by.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Etheopian and Indonesian in-house medium roast (the <em>Collective Blend</em>) was subtle and tasty - I wasn‚Äôt smacked across the face with fruit or punched in the nose with dark-chocolately bitterness.
The notes on the package mentioned dark cherry and pear; I can see where they got <em>pear</em> but <em>grapefruit</em> is the predominant flavor that came to mind.</p>

<p>It was enjoyable! I would have it again, but I‚Äôm not rushing back or sending out recomendations to all my friends.</p>

<p>The <em>sea-salt iced matcha latte</em> the person in front of me ordered looked beautiful, and I heard several people mention how much they liked it - if you‚Äôre a matcha latte kinda person, this might be a fun stop.</p>

<h1 id="my-takeaways">My Takeaways</h1>

<p>The most common names in these blogs are probably:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Coava</li>
  <li>Proud Mary</li>
  <li>Case Study</li>
  <li>Heart</li>
  <li>Stumptown</li>
</ol>

<p>If you visit any given cafe in Portland, chances are high their beans come from either Heart, Coava or Proud Mary, and for good reason.
All three of them are local and put out some <em>solid</em> roasts‚Ä¶ but I still recommend finding some smaller shops that still roast in-house.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the most <em>underrated</em> cafes and roasters are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sterling</li>
  <li>Deadstock</li>
  <li>Courier</li>
</ol>

<p>and the most <em>overrated</em> are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stumptown</li>
  <li>Case Study</li>
  <li>Never Coffee (unless you really like lattes)</li>
  <li>PUSH X PULL</li>

<p>The Never Coffee cafe on SW 12th and Alder is one of the nicest cafe environments I‚Äôve found so far, with a modern feel and pastel color palette. 
They got a low score from me simply because their espresso was not my favorite - it felt a little bland, not overly fruity or dark and rich, somewhere in the middle with less flavor than I was hoping for.</p>

<p>I had their Bangarang roast, a blend of washed Kenyan, washed Peruvian, and honey-process Honduran beans, which the barista was more than happy to tell me about - they clearly care about coffee, roast in-house, and take creative steps with their drinks, but their espresso was not for me and that‚Äôs my measuring stick.</p>

<p>Other reviews of Never Coffee call out their lattes as very above-average, which seems to be the case; almost every single person I saw in the cafe in the morning I spent there chose one of their 5 unique latte flavors, and I was the only one with a doppio.</p>

<p>If you stop by, maybe try one of their lattes.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>‚Ä¶and Coava was mine.</em></strong></p>

<p>They are the first Portland-local roaster and cafe I fell in love with.</p>

<p>When I first moved to Portland, there was a Coava cafe in the same building as my apartment, on the lobby floor.
Nearly all 5 work-days, nearly every week since I moved here, I worked from that cafe in the upstairs seating area surrounded by Monstera Deliciosas, PSU students, and speakers playing indi tracks I‚Äôd never heard before.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve consumed more Coava espresso than any other form of espresso in my life by a <strong><em>long shot</em></strong>.
It‚Äôs no surprise that they earn a perfect 10/10; fruity but not too blond, bitter but not too dark.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll forever mourn their west-side location, but their headquarters shop on SE Main and Grand right off the 6 bus line is a much nicer cafe anyways.
The seating area is home to beautiful woodworking projects from <em>Bamboo Revolution</em> with whom Coava shares a space, along with antique roasting equipment and open-air garage doors and fans (at least in the summer time).</p>

<p>For this review I had a doppio of the <em>Java Papatong</em>, a washed-process from Indonesia, but I‚Äôve loved many of their other roasts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the San Marcos,</li>
  <li>the SO Blend from the Americas and East Africa,</li>
  <li>the Darfusu washed process,</li>
  <li>the Fazenda Serra do Bon√© from Brazil,</li>
</ul>

<p>and plenty of others. Their roasts are all seasonal, so try whatever they have.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>

<p>In the spring and summer of 2023 I started a list of coffee shops to evaluate.
By the end of the summer I hope to have established a rough ranking of the best shops,
along with some honorable mentions for great shops to work from.</p>

<p>Here are some of the early contenders:</p>

<p>The second shop to get a 10/10 on my arbitrary rating system blew me away.
I‚Äôm not usually a huge fan of fruity espresso, but the double-fermented Las Frutas roasted in-house was the best espresso I‚Äôve had to date.
The columbian beans were sealed in water bags for 72 hours before another 30 hour wet-tank soak were incredible.
The roaster and barista recomended Sterling Coffee Roasters for my next espresso, so I‚Äôm hopeful that Sterling will rate pretty highly as well.</p>

<p>Ovation Coffee and Tea was the first shop to be awarded a perfect 10/10.
The location in PSU‚Äôs campus right off the North-South streetcar line has plenty of space to work and REALLY cute porcelein cups.</p>

<h2 id="behind-the-museum">Behind the Museum</h2>

<p>The Behind the Museum cafe‚Äôs beautiful floor-to-ceiling windows and Japanese pottery along the walls make for an
especially nice work environment, especially when it‚Äôs raining -
the rain rolling off those massive windows immediately puts you at ease.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding the best espresso in one of the homes of 3rd-wave coffee.]]></summary></entry></feed>
