***"Coffee should be dope"***

-->

Nestled in central Chinatown, this cafe front for a roastery has their own streetwear line and feels like a trap-house recording studio.
Self-termed ***Portland's Hype Barista***, Nike Jordan 1s are hung up everywhere and trap plays over the speakers all day.

The *BREEZY Don Enrique* Colombian single-origin medium roast was *seriously* good.
As soon as I finish making this espresso tour, I plan on coming back here to buy a bag or two of the BREEZY - it was one of the best-smelling roasts I've come across in the last year.

I haven't seen DEADSTOCK mentioned on many blogs, which feels like an injustice.
Definitely worth stopping by.
