Unique energy, passionate about espresso.

Named for it's location relative to the Ladd's Edition neighborhood in SE Portland, this roaster and cafe front has *several* roasts available for espresso at any given time (and one or two more specifically for drip and pour-over).

The flavor comps for the roast I tried were absolutely spot-on: I got strong notes of sweetness and white chocolate from the *90h Tabi*.
These Tabi beans from Tolima, Colombia underwent a 90-hour submerged fermentation process.
I hadn't heard of the Tabi variety before: it's a hybrid of bourbon, typica, and timor varietials.
<strong>
    Upper Left is *clearly* passionate about espresso, but has something for everyone: more than half of the patrons were sporting iced lattes on the Friday afternoon I stopped in.
</strong>

The venue is very unique as well: the roasting machine is separated from the cafe by only a bar seating area; you can sit right next to the roasting machine if you like.
The white walls, light wooden furnishing, and ample indoor and outdoor seating made for a wonderful environment.

Speaking of the outdoor seating, there was a DJ playing lowkey club mixes over industrial-sized speakers in the outdoor seating area which happened to be almost entirely full; the neighborhood clearly takes full advantage of having this cafe so accessible.

Upper Left is a must-try.
