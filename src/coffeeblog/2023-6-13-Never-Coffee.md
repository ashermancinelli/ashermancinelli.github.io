Not my favorite, but it might be yours.

The Never Coffee cafe on SW 12th and Alder is one of the nicest cafe environments I've found so far, with a modern feel and pastel color palette. 
They got a low score from me simply because their espresso was not my favorite - it felt a little bland, not overly fruity or dark and rich, somewhere in the middle with less flavor than I was hoping for.

I had their Bangarang roast, a blend of washed Kenyan, washed Peruvian, and honey-process Honduran beans, which the barista was more than happy to tell me about - they clearly care about coffee, roast in-house, and take creative steps with their drinks, but their espresso was not for me and that's my measuring stick.

Other reviews of Never Coffee call out their lattes as very above-average, which seems to be the case; almost every single person I saw in the cafe in the morning I spent there chose one of their 5 unique latte flavors, and I was the only one with a doppio.

If you stop by, maybe try one of their lattes.
