Enjoyable, but not my first recomendation.

The Etheopian and Indonesian in-house medium roast (the *Collective Blend*) was subtle and tasty - I wasn't smacked across the face with fruit or punched in the nose with dark-chocolately bitterness.
The notes on the package mentioned dark cherry and pear; I can see where they got *pear* but *grapefruit* is the predominant flavor that came to mind.

It was enjoyable! I would have it again, but I'm not rushing back or sending out recomendations to all my friends.

The *sea-salt iced matcha latte* the person in front of me ordered looked beautiful, and I heard several people mention how much they liked it - if you're a matcha latte kinda person, this might be a fun stop.
