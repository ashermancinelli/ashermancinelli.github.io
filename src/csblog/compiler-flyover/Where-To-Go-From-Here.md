# Where To Go From Here

~~~admonish todo
- textbook and lecture suggestions
- modern compiler projects to get involved in
    - llvm getting started page
    - suggesion of things to start working on
    - example of writing an llvm patch start-to-finish
- youtube channels
    - I've learned a tremendous amount about compilers from watching conference talks
        from people involved in various compilers
    - you get direct access to exactly what very senior compiler engineers want you to know
    - treasure trove of information only otherwise accessible by doing a phd with
        a quality advisor or by already having a job as a compiler engineer.
        pls take advantage of this
- llvm discord
- gcc community page
