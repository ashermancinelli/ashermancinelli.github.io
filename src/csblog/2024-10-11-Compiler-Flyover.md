# Compiler Flyover

Overview of compilers and what I do for work, from ancient Greek philosophy to today.

I wrote this for some friends where we all gave a little presentation on what we do for work.

The topics were ordered with *people already interested in but not familiar with compilers* in mind.
If you're already familiar with compilers, then the following sections may be most interesting to you:

1. [Tour of Optimizations](compiler-flyover/Optimizers.md)
1. [History](compiler-flyover/00-History.md)
