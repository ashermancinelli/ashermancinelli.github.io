# Compiler Flyover

An overview of compilers: their history, development, and theory.

~~~ admonish tip

The topics were ordered with *people already interested in but not familiar with compilers* in mind.
If you're already familiar with compilers, then the following sections may be most interesting to you:

1. [Tour of Optimizations](compiler-flyover/Optimizers.md)
1. [History](compiler-flyover/00-History.md)

~~~admonish tip

Nearly everything covered in this blog series is worth a textbook
of its own. Please don't assume that this series is exhaustive;
I'm writing it primarily for my own entertainment.
