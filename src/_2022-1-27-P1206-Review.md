My notes on [_Conversions from ranges to containers_, r7](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p1206r7.pdf).

<!-- {% include disclaimer.html %} -->

### _Overview_ section

Comment contains a spelling error:
```cpp
//Pipe syntaxe
             â†‘
auto g = l | ranges::view::take(42) | ranges::to<std::vector>();
```

### _Considerations_ section

'Cpp17Iterators' is not italicized as it is elsewhere in the paper.

> This is sufficiently complex and error-prone approach that multiple blog posts and stackoverflow questions address it:

might be better written as:

> This approach is sufficiently complex and error-prone such that multiple blog posts and stackoverflow questions address it:

### _CTAD_ section

> Adding a tag solves this issue(although one needs to remember using a tag!).

There seems to be no space in between "issue" and the open paren.

The following might be more readable:

> Adding a tag solves this issue (although one must remember to use a tag!).

### _Ambiguous conversions_ section

> There are other issues is with `vector<any>`.

The following might be more readable:

> The other issue is with `vector<any>`.

Uses of `std::` are inconsistent: why use bare `any` but keep `std::vector`?

`any` is also used without code font in this section.

### _using from_range_ section

Many instances of `char const*` and `vector<...>` do not use code font.
