# Welcome

I find compilers, programming languages and performance _really_ interesting.

My personal notes and blog posts are enumerated on the left, or you can use the search bar at the top.

Professionally, I work on [the NVHPC C, C++ and Fortran compilers at NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk).

```admonish tip title="Heads up!"
For code blocks with shell commands, I use `;` instead of the typical `$`.
This way, if you use the button in the top-right of the code block to copy the commands,
the semicolon doesn't mess up the commands like `$` does.
```
