# Values Statement

```admonish tldr
These values motivate and inform how I work.

They are _values_, meaning I _aspire_ to live up to them and they are at times in tension with each other.

They are: **curiosity, honesty, rigor, communication, empathy.**
```

## Curiosity

* I _chose_ to take an orientation of curiosity towards any problem I work on.
    Replace feelings of frustration, anger and disappointment with curiosity when possible.

## Honesty

* My coworkers should expect everything I say to be my complete and honest understanding.
* I ask when I don't understand something.
* When I present a solution, I point out what I do _and_ don't understand.
    I am not afraid to be wrong or change my opinion, publicly.
* This includes times when honesty is uncomfortable or inconvenient, including when I have made a mistake.

## Rigor

* Any artifact of my work should clearly demonstrate rigor and thoughtfulness.

* When describing issues or summarizing an investigation, I should include the possible solutions that I see, and give a recommendation.
    If someone else must read my report, come up with possible solutions and give a recommendation, that report was unfinished.
    When assigning me a problem, my assigner should expect a rigorous investigation, a range of possible solutions, and a preferred recommendation.

* Rigor implies good engineering. I write quality code.

## Effective Communication

* Effective written and spoken communication must be a core competency.
    Emails, comments, code review, personal messages and official documents convey the appropriate tone and level of detail.
* Comments in software are the guideposts for future developers, most importantly myself.
* When speaking, I am either prepared to speak or explain that I will speak more at a later time when I _am_ prepared.

## Empathy

* In any communication, I consider how it will be received, who is receiving it, and how they may feel about it.

* The code I write considers the user and the next developer to read or modify it.
    Have empathy on the developer that maintains your code, because it will most likely be you.
* This includes writing tools for tasks that others also perform.
    Share the value of your work with others and deduplicate where possible.
    Make other's lives better.
