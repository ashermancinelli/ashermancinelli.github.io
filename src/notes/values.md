# Values Statement

```admonish tldr
These principles motivate and inform how I work.
They are _principles_, meaning I _aspire_ to live up to them.
```

## Curiosity

I _chose_ to take an orientation of curiosity towards any problem I work on.
Replace feelings of frustration, anger and disappointment with curiosity.

## Honesty

My coworkers should expect everything I say to be my complete and honest understanding of the situation.

I speak up or ask someone when I don't understand something.

When I present a solution, I outline what I do and don't understand.
I ask more experienced coworkers for input when I don't understand something.
I am not afraid to be wrong or change my opinion, publicly.

## Rigor

Any artifact of my work should clearly demonstrate rigor and thoughtfulness.
A half-finished job is nearly the same as an unfinished job.

When describing issues or summarizing an investigation, I should include the possible solutions that I see, and give a recommendation.
If someone else must read my report, come up with possible solutions and give a recommendation, that report was unfinished.
When assigning me a problem, my assigner should expect a rigorous investigation, a range of possible solutions, and a preferred recommendation.

## Precise Communication

Written communication must be a core competency.
Emails, comments, code review, slack messages and official documents must have the appropriate tone, level of detail
Comments in software are the guideposts for future developers, most importantly myself.

## Empathy

In any communication, I consider how it will be received.
