  <div class="entry">
    <p>Pleasant, mild, unique, imported roasts from Sweden - try some beans you’ll likely not find anywhere else!</p>

<hr>

<p>The first thing I look for when I walk into a new cafe in the Portland area is the coffee bags the shop is selling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are they using Coava or Proud Mary beans? Do they roast their own? Am I trying something new today, or maybe an old favorite?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Walking into Adapt Cafe in SE, I was surprised to see bags I’d not seen before - light and modern packaging around small, 250 gram bags from <em>Morgon Coffee Roasters</em> from Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>

<p>The swedish beans bled out into the design language of the shop - smallish seating area with huge windows and modern-feeling all-black furnishing against white walls.
The barista was happy to tell me about the imported roasts from the <em>very</em> young 5-year-old roasting company they buy from, and the rapid pace at which they have been winning awards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our combined resume contains… competing in most things coffee.
Some of those competitions resulted in a <strong><em>bronze in roasting, two silvers in brewing and two gold medals in coffee tasting</em></strong>.</p>

  <p>In 2020 we had our first prize spotlight for Morgon when we were <strong><em>finalists in the 12th annual international Sprudgie’s award as “Most notable roaster in 2020”</em></strong>.</p>

  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I found the espresso to be very pleasant, on the mild side - the primary flavor comp I experienced was <em>plum</em>; a touch of sweetness and sourness, but not really any citrus <em>per se</em>, and certainly not much bitterness.
After the first sip, I couldn’t tell if it was more sour or bitter.
It wasn’t until the second and third sip that I made up my mind; that’s how subtle it was.
The other flavor comps were structured, chocolate, and bisuit, but I could only really pick up notes of plum.</p>

<p>I had their honey process Costa Rican beans of the <a href="https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/varieties/catuai">Catuai variety of Arabica</a> from the Montero family - at first I thought <em>Montero</em> might have been referring to a coffee <em>variety</em> I’d not yet heard of, but no: these beans were <em>grown</em> by the Montero family, and <a href="https://www.morgoncoffeeroasters.com/products/carlos-montero-costa-rica-tarrazu">Morgon’s website has a whole page about their relationship with the Montero family</a>.
Carlos Montero even visited Morgon in Gothenburg to see their roasting operation.</p>

<p>For being a dark-roast kinda guy, I <em>really</em> enjoyed their espresso.
It’s obvious they care about coffee, their baristas are knoledgable, and they get their beans from a <em>serious</em> roasting company.
I would love to see more Morgon beans around town, maybe even in a second Adapt Cafe location.
I think they would get a lot of business in a more central location, though I do enjoy how many local roasters get the spotlight in cafes downtown.</p>
