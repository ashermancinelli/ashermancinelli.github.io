  <h1>Rose City Coffee - 7/10</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Do you like blonde roasts or need a beautiful space to get some work done?</p>

<hr>

<p>The first thing to draw me in to a coffee shop is usually the smells - pastries, coffee, and maybe the nutty wooden smell of roasting if Iâ€™m lucky enough to be in a roastery.</p>

<p>Walking into Rose City Coffee however, I was struck by the dark cherry-wood and soft-touch-textured metal furnishing, the brick walls, and the wide-open cafe space - there are no walls or furniture to obstruct your view of one side of the cafe from the other, combining with the floor-to-celeing windows to make the space feel larger than it is.</p>

<hr>

<p>I had the <em>Floribunda</em>, a medium blend with chocolate and floral flavor compsâ€¦ and thatâ€™s about all I could find about the roast between asking in the shop and looking online.
This is obviously not an espresso specialty shop, but my doppio was still alright.</p>

<p>I got quite a bit of sourness up front, without much darkness or bitterness to balance it out.
If youâ€™re a fiend for blonde roasts, this would be a pretty fun place to stop - but the menu seems to emphasize lattes, so I donâ€™t know that I would recommend this spot to a huge fan of blonde <em>espresso</em>.</p>

<p><em>Personally</em>, I would have loved a darker roast and a <em>LOT</em> more information about the beans, but espresso isnâ€™t every shopâ€™s emphasis, and thatâ€™s alright too.
Their food options looked (and smelled) amazing as well.</p>

<p>Rose City will live in my head as the place to go if I need to stay put somewhere for all day - great food, decent coffee, and a free-feeling space that I could spend a whole workday at.</p>

<hr>

<p>On top of the food, coffee, and environment, the friend that recommended this place to me remarked that they have live music on Saturdays!
The community events add to Rose Cityâ€™s vibe, which leaves it feeling remarkably like the Flying M coffee shop in the Boise, Idaho area, my all-around favorite shop from my time living there.</p>

<p>The Flying M will always have a special place in my heart, so I canâ€™t help but feel sentimental cracking open my laptop to get some work done in the refreshing Rose City seating area.
Itâ€™s worth stopping by if youâ€™re in the SE part of the city (especially on a Saturday ðŸ˜Š).</p>
