  <h1>Worth Being Wrong</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>What is worth living for? How much of my life should be spent to figuring out what’s technically correct when I could be using my time to help the material conditions of my neighbor?</p>

<h1 id="whats-worth-being-wrong-about">What’s Worth Being Wrong About?</h1>

<p>I was given a set of ideas to see the world through, a toolbox for interacting with ideas and experiences.
This toolbox fell short a long time ago for many reasons which won’t be enumerated here.</p>

<p>The castle of ideas was built up in my mind over many years, and in a few short years I tore many of those walls down.
Since then, I’ve been rebuilding, reconstructing, tearing down again, and rebuilding some more.
I guess this is just a dialectic - not all that special.</p>

<p>I only have so much time and energy in this life, and I can keep building and tearing down again, or I can lift my eyes to the material conditions of my neighbors.
At some point, sorting out my philosophy became less of a priority.</p>

<p>There must come a point where I’m comfortable working with the castle I’ve built, otherwise I’ll keep adding a brick here, breaking another there, and one day I’ll look around me and realize I’m in a half-built castle in a field of half-built castles, and I could have joined my neighbor in their half-built castle years ago.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I know enough to know what I’m willing to risk being wrong about, what else do I need to figure out?</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="a-process-god">A Process God?</h1>

<p>Tripp Fuller has been instrumental in my philisophical and religious development, and is likely a large reason I still consider myself christian.</p>

<p>He gives me hope.</p>

<p>Tyson does too.</p>

<p>There are few of them, but their words go so far.</p>

<p>When I consider the God I encounter in Jesus, I think of the christian god of process theology, at least as I understand it.
If all experience that has ever been experienced were rolled up into one being, what would that being have to say?
Let’s call that being god.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would God say to you?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If God were to walk among us, who would God become?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who would that God shape us to be?</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="could-he-have-been-wrong">Could He Have Been Wrong?</h1>

<p>John Dominic Crosson’s picture of Jesus is compelling to me - we can’t look back at how 1st c people talked about Ceasar and not apply those same rules to Jesus.
If we talk about Ceasar being a god, we can talk about Jesus being God.
If we look at the Romans and consider their notion of Ceasar’s godhood as mythology, we must apply the same reasoning to Jesus.</p>

<p>This doesn’t discount the story of Jesus however.</p>

<h2 id="mythology-as-reality">Mythology as Reality</h2>

<p>The myth of Jesus has shaped all of reality to a staggering degree.
Myths shape reality more than factual information, and if that doesn’t ring true to you, you’re not paying attention.</p>
