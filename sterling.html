  <h1>Sterling - 10/10</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>This place is something special. <em>Please</em> don’t leave Portland without trying their espresso.</p>

<hr>

<p>Prior to trying Sterling’s espresso, the #1 on my list was from Courier Coffee.
When I told the barista at Courier how much I enjoyed their espresso, he made sure to recommend Sterling for my next stop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, you like espresso? Yeah, you should definitely check out Sterling</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He backed that comment up with a few more remarks about how special their espresso is, and it went to the top of my list of places to try next.
It did not dissapoint.</p>

<hr>

<p>The barista was excited to welcome me in and tell me all about the roast they had ready for espresso, which happened to be the <em>Nigusse Lemma</em>, a natural-process small-batch Ethiopian roast with Etheopian Heriloom varietals.
I got the same feelings I get trying a new whiskey at the Scotch Lounge on the East side of town - she talked through the roasting process at their East-side roastery and the origins of the beans.</p>

<p>After pulling the shot, she put together a board with a small glass of sparkling water as a pallate clenser (as is usual in espresso-focused cafes).</p>

<p>Adding to the Scotch Lounge feelings, the espresso was served in a glencairn-style whiskey serving glass along with a third glass with a drip brew so as to try the roast from another perspective.</p>

<p>Both coffees were smooth and creamy - I jotted down <em>notes of strawberries and cream</em> before I even saw <em>“Raspberry &amp; Vanilla Cream”</em> listed as flavor comps on the bag of coffee they used for my espresso.</p>

<hr>

<p>This espresso struck me as <strong><em>perfectly balanced</em></strong> - without hesitation, I wanted to share it with every one of my friends still not won over by espresso.
In my experience, when people try espresso and decide they hate it, 95% of the time it’s due to the intensity of the flavors, especially with sour and bitter notes.
When I try an intense espresso, something that punches you in the mouth with sourness or fruit or bitterness or chocolate or nuttiness, I can enjoy the intensity (if it’s done well!) - but that seems to be the attribute of espresso that puts people off of it.</p>

<p>This espresso was not intense in the usual way, but not too mild either.
It was full of flavor with delicious notes of citrus, cream, a balance of bitterness to round out the flavor profile, yet not too intense to be someone’s first espresso.</p>

<p>This espresso, along with their drip brew, the knowledgable baristas, and a cozy cafe seating area nestled into NW Portland with indoor trees and fast wifi brings this to the top of my list.</p>

<p>As I work out an espresso tour of Portland, I <em>have</em> to pencil Sterling in as the final destination.
I would want any espresso afficionado visiting the city to finish their time here with a Sterling espresso.</p>
